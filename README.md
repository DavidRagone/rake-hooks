Rake hooks let you add callbacks to rake:

## Usage

For example in your Rakefile

```ruby
require 'rake/hooks'

task :say_hello do
  puts "Good Morning !"
end

after :say_hello do
  puts "GoodBye"
end

after :say_hello do
  puts "Now go to bed !"
end

before :say_hello do
  puts "Hi !"
end
```

Now run with rake

```bash
$ rake say_hello
Hi !
Good Morning !
GoodBye
Now go to bed !
```

You can also pass more than one task and each task will be setup with the
callback

```ruby
before :say_hello, :say_goodbye do
  puts "Hi !"
end
```

If you need to save local state in your tasks, you can use `around`. **Note**
that the block you pass to `around` should expect a parameter, which is the
original rake task. In order for this task to run, you need to call `#invoke` on
it at whatever point you want it run.

```ruby
require 'rake/hooks'

task :slow_things do
  sleep rand 5
end

around :slow_things do |original|
  start = Time.now
  original.invoke
  finished = Time.now
  puts "Task took #{finished - start} seconds"
end
```

Now run with rake

```bash
$ rake slow_things
Task took 3.004006 seconds
```
